Unfortunately, the project had been registered in a private repository made available by the University, but it was deleted ...
Despite the date of the project, the computer changes, we were able to find an old version, however, it contains errors that the final version does not contain.

We apologize for the inconvenience, we don't think the repository was going to be deleted.
Despite the errors in this version, you can still analyze code that contains dynamic allocation, memory management, and some algorithm.

This was our very first project of our life in the 1st year of the Bachelor. Please look at more recent projects if you want to analyze my current projects.
